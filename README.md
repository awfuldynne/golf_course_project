# pygolfdata
Pygolfdata is a tool to help users interested in correlating [PGA ShotLink](https://www.pgatour.com/stats/shotlinkintelligence/overview.html) data with weather data. Weather observations are taken from a historical weather API that provides hourly snapshots. 

# Limitations
The use of [PGA Shotlink](https://shotlinkintelligence.pgatourhq.com/Tour/ShotLinkAgreement/ShotLinkAgreement.nsf/frm_Registration.xsp%20) data is restricted to academic purposes and requires that a user fill out the linked form to request their own access.

Access to the [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) APIs are gated by requesting an API key. While initially free, these API keys each have a limit on usage per day before requiringpayment.
