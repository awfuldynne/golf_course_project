# Data

This document outlines the data retrieved and used for this project, and explains how the data is stored and accessed by the code.

## Data repository

- TODO cover that we have a separate repo, why, and how the main repo incorporates it as the data dir using submodules, and that we use Git LFS; point to SHotLink dat section for organization (what files, etc.) and to the Travis section for how we get access in the CI VM.
- TODO also cover that we have two repos, one for general exploration w/ more data and one with a more minimal set that we ended up using for our analysis (to make it quicker/cheaper to get things locally and in the CI VM)
 

## ShotLink data

[ShotLink](https://www.pgatour.com/stats/shotlinkintelligence/overview.html) contains detailed information about every stroke taken on most PGA Tour events, over many years. It's available for use in academic environments as specified on the ShotLink site. Each of the members of our project team obtained permission to use the data, and we stored the data in a separate and private GitHub repo, as explained in the [#ShotLink data] section above.

We chose to use the following ShotLink datasets. All of these are accessible using the PGA Tour's "Stat Inquiry System", in the "Tool" section and the "Detail Export" option. Where possible - strokes, holes, rounds, events - we used the pre-generated by-year data sets. In cases where pre-generated datasets weren't available we requested the data by year using the site's "filtered export" functionality.
- **Stroke level**. This data set has a row per shot/stroke taken on each PGA Tour event, and provides the majority of the ShotLink data we use. We store it in the root directory of the data repository as a compressed .zip file per year - for example, Shot2017.TXT.zip, Shot2016.TXT.zip - and unzip the data into semicolon-delimited text files - with names like Shot2017.TXT - by running the unzip.py script in the same directory.
- **Course level**. This data set contains supplemental data about the courses, such as the width of the fairway at various distances, measures of the height of the grass in various locations, a measure of the speed of the green using a [Stimpmeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimpmeter), and more. We join it with the shot data to provide additional data that might be relevant when analyzing shot performance. Like with the stroke data, we store it as compressed files with names like CourseLevel2017.TXT.zip and then unzip after cloning the repo and before doing analysis.

We also evaluated the following datasets and chose not to use them - mainly because the data they hold is summaries of the data that exists in more granular form in the stroke data set, in the case of holes, rounds, and events, or because the data wasn't applicable to the analysis we we performed, in the case of radar launch and trajectory.

- Holes.
- Rounds.
- Events.
- Radar launch.
- Radar trajectory.

TBD include whatever is specified/required by ShotLink agreement.
